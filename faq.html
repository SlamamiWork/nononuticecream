            What are the Top 8 Allergens?
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            Congress passed the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004
(FALCPA). This law identified eight foods as major food allergens: milk, eggs, fish,
Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans.<br><br>

On April 23, 2021, the Food Allergy Safety, Treatment, Education, and Research
(FASTER) Act was signed into law, declaring sesame as the 9th major food allergen
recognized by the United States. The change was effective on January 1, 2023.<br><br>

            What is a food allergy?
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            A food allergy is a medical condition in which exposure to a food triggers a harmful
immune response. The immune response, called an allergic reaction, occurs because
the immune system attacks proteins in the food that are normally harmless. The
proteins that trigger the reaction are called allergens.<br><br>

Food allergy is a serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition affecting 33
million Americans. One in every 13 children has a food allergy—that’s about 2 in every
U.S. classroom. And every 3 minutes, a food allergy reaction sends someone to the
emergency room.
        </p><p class="faq-q">
            What does a food allergy look like?
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            The symptoms of an allergic reaction to food can range from mild (itchy mouth, a few
hives) to severe (throat tightening, difficulty breathing).<br><br>

Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is sudden in onset and can cause death.
There is no cure for food allergy. Food allergies are managed by avoiding the problem
food(s) and learning to recognize and treat reactions symptoms.<br><br>

            What is cross contact?
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            Cross-contact happens when one food comes into contact with another food and their
proteins mix. As a result, each food then contains small amounts of the other food.
These amounts are so small that they usually can’t be seen.<br><br>

Even this tiny amount of food protein has caused reactions in people with food allergies!
The term “cross-contact” is fairly new. Some people may call this “cross-contamination.”<br><br>

            What is in your concoctions?
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            We believe in full transparency. None of the fake or hidden stuff. We do not use any artificial dyes of flavorings. We aim to use simple, fresh ingredients as much as possible. When we do use processed ingredients, we only use products from companies that are designated free from peanuts, tree nuts, dairy and gluten and are produced in dedicated facilities free of these allergens. Also available at our storefront is a reference guide with each flavor and all its yummy secrets so you don't have to worry about hidden unknowns.

                What is your ice cream base?
            </p><p class="faq-a">
                Our ice cream base is made from Chaokoh coconut milk that when produced at a
commercial size, is not cross contacted with other allergens. We do want to have full
transparency and notice that many factory practices do not align with our morals and
values however Chaokoh has addressed your concerns with the statement below.<br><br>

“Additionally, Theppadungporn Coconut Co., Ltd. (TCC), the manufacturer and
distributor of Chaokoh coconut milk, ensures zero monkey labour in its coconut
production. Theppadungporn Coconut has signed a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with local suppliers and farmers in Thailand for monkey-free coconut cultivation.
Theppadungporn Coconut has been handing out more than 250,000 dwarf coconut
trees to the local farmers since 2010. The dwarf coconut varieties will facilitate
harvesting by man and improve good farming practices. Eligible farm inspections are
also carried out to verify that the contracted coconut farmers meet Chaokoh's
requirements - including zero monkey labour harvesting. Theppadungporn Coconut has
also initiated its traceability program, which allows the discerning customers to trace
and track the coconut milk products throughout the supply chain.”<br><br>

            But coconut is a nut?!
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            Well, no but we will get to that in a moment. We chose coconut cream for the base of our ice cream because it is neutral flavor is excellent for accepting all of our amazing flavor creations. Most importantly though while a coconut allergy can exist, it is considered much more rare compared to other options. Now for a brief educational moment...coconut is botanically a drupe - not a nut. "The name comes from the old Portuguese word coco, meaning "head" or "skull", after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features."

        “Coconuts are classified as a fibrous one-seeded drupe. A
        drupe is a fruit with a hard stony covering enclosing the seed
        (like a peach or olive) and comes from the word drupa
        meaning overripe olive. A coconut, and all drupes, have
        three layers: the exocarp (outer layer), the mesocarp (fleshy
        middle layer), and the endocarp (hard, woody layer that
        surrounds the seed).”<br><br>
