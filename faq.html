            What is in your concoctions?
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            We believe in full transparency. None of the fake or hidden stuff. We do not use any artificial dyes of flavorings. We aim to use simple, fresh ingredients as much as possible. When we do use processed ingredients, we only use products from companies that are designated free from peanuts, tree nuts, dairy and gluten and are produced in dedicated facilities free of these allergens. Also available at our storefront is a reference guide with each flavor and all its yummy secrets so you don't have to worry about hidden unknowns.

            But coconut is a nut?!
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            Well, no but we will get to that in a moment. We chose coconut cream for the base of our ice cream because it is neutral flavor is excellent for accepting all of our amazing flavor creations. Most importantly though while a coconut allergy can exist, it is considered much more rare compared to other options. Now for a brief educational moment...coconut is botanically a drupe - not a nut. "The name comes from the old Portuguese word coco, meaning "head" or "skull", after the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features."
        </p><p class="faq-q">
            Can you accommodate other allergens?
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            We recognize that there are countless combinations within the food allergy community and wish we could accommodate all of them. If you have a special concern, please do not hesitate to contact us. We will happily discuss our products and capabilities to do everything we can so that you don't feel excluded with keeping your utmost safety in mind.
        </p><p class="faq-q">
            Is your facility nut, dairy and gluten free?
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            Yes! Our kitchen, equipment and all preparation areas are free from peanuts, tree nuts, dairy and gluten down to our cleaning supplies. We provide a no cost snack station for our employees stocked with items free from these allergens. We also provide a dedicated space outside the facility for our employees to consume any food of their choosing without risk of cross contact with our kitchen. In compliance with food safety regulations, all employees wash their hands upon entering the facility and gloves are worn during all food preparation and service.
        </p><p class="faq-q"> 
            Anything else I should know?
        </p><p class="faq-a">
            Come hang out, relax and make a memory! Our back patio may be small, but it's mighty with yard games, a water table, a Free Little Library and more. The patio also offers a hand washing station for patrons to use at their convenience because there's nothing food allergy heroes love more than a good, soapy handwashing.
