      <h2 class="section-title">No No Nut Ice Cream</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">"When our son was diagnosed with food allergies as a toddler, our world was flipped upside down. Suddenly, everything we knew, everything we fed him felt like it was a potential enemy. The simplest act of staying alive became a constant worry of possible death. We realized we had a choice: to simply survive or thrive. We worked hard to cultivate a family culture of careful not fearful, but over time, no matter how diligent we planned, a sense of exclusion still hovered.</p>
        <p class="section-subtitle">As our family, experiences, and travels grew so did the types of allergies and intolerance we came in contact with. Whether at home or away, we noticed a lack of safe ice cream options available for dine in or take home due to the risk of cross contamination. We understood, but we were frustrated. People deserve a great place to eat great treats safely.</p>
        <p class="section-subtitle">In response, we chose to focus on the top allergens most commonly present in ice cream shops: peanuts, tree nuts, dairy and gluten. We also chose to keep artificial dyes or flavorings out of our recipes because who needs that stuff?</p>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Keep it tasty.
        <br>Keep it simple.
        <br>Keep it safe.</p>
        <p class="section-subtitle">No Nuts, No Dairy, No Gluten, No Dyes, No Lies."</p>
