            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
            <p>When our son was diagnosed with food allergies as a toddler, our world was flipped upside down. Suddenly, everything we knew, everything we fed him felt like it was a potential enemy. The simplest act of staying alive became a constant worry of possible death. We realized we had a choice: to simply survive or thrive. We worked hard to cultivate a family culture of careful not fearful, but over time no matter how diligent we planned, a sense of exclusion still hovered.</p>
            <p>As our family, experiences, and travels grew so did the types of allergies and intolerance we came in contact with. Rather at home or away, we noticed a lack of safe ice cream options available for dine in or take home due to the risk of cross contact. We understood, but we were frustrated. People deserve a great place to eat great treats safely.</p>
            <p>In response, we chose to create recipes in a dedicated kitchen free of the Top 8 allergens.</p>
            <p>Keep it tasty.</p>
            <p>Keep it simple.</p>
            <p>Keep it safe.</p>
            <p>No Nuts, No Dairy, No Gluten, No Dyes, No Lies.</p>
